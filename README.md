# juce-widgets
An unsorted bunch of useful widgets build for the JUCE cross-platform library


## Usage

This repository is meant to be included as a git submodule in a main project, see for instance [JammerNetz](https://github.com/christofmuc/JammerNetz) for an example how this is used.
In order to build this library standalone, which is what the CI server should be doing, there is a separate little repository that you can use.

For what is in this library, please use the header files to see the utility functions, I am busy with my main projects and can't add more documentation right now.

## Attributing

If you use the PatchButton class with the icons, make sure to attribute the icon author:

    "Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com"

## Contributing
